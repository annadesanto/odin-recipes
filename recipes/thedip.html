    <h1>"The Dip"
    </h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Among some of my friends, this has become known as “The Dip,” and now I literally 
        cannot attend any social gathering or host any dinner party without someone 
        requesting “The Dip.” When you make it, you’ll know why. It’s my very high-brow 
        version of ranch dressing, and that’s all the intel you need. But if you’d 
        like to know more, there is a scalliony chile oil that gets sizzled with cilantro 
        stems (or chives) and swirled into thick, lemony labne. From there, I’m sure you 
        can assume that the combination of tangy dairy coupled with that herby chile oil 
        already sounds incredible, and maybe you are on your way to making this right now.
        If you can find green garlic (which tends to be hyper-seasonal and mostly found only
         at farmers’ markets), use them (or even ramps!) in place of the scallions.
