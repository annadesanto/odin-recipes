<h1>Chicken Soup for Summer Colds</h"1>
<img src="../img/chicksoup.jpg" alt="Chicken Soup for Summer Colds" height="300" >
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This soup started because what I was really needing was a giant bowl of broth. I gently simmered a whole chicken in a large pot of lightly salted water with onions, a few rogue carrots, and about a half bunch of celery for 2-ish hours until the chicken was effectively braised and the water had turned to stock. If you donâ€™t have the desire to go that route, you can use boxed/store-bought chicken (or vegetable broth) and leftover chicken/picked rotisserie (or cut-up tofu).
    </p>
