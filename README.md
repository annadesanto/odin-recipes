# odin-recipes
In this project I will build a basic recipe website. 
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a a few recipes.
The goal of this project is to get comfortable with HTML and git basics. 
I aim to commit changes often and practice using correct commit messages.
I will return to this to reflect on what I have learned.
